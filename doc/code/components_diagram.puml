' Relationships
file_listener --> config : reads configuration

note right of file_listener
  Watches directory for file
  changes and publishes events
  to NATS with path, operation,
  and file size information
end note

note right of monitor
  Subscribes to file events from
  NATS JetStream and logs them
  to a file with timestamp
end note

note bottom of jetstream
  Provides persistent storage for events,
  ensuring delivery even if components
  are temporarily offline
end note

note bottom of telemetry
  Provides OpenTelemetry tracing
  for monitoring and diagnostics
  (work in progress)
end note
