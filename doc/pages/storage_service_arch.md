## Scalability Approach

The architecture employs several strategies to ensure scalability:

1. **Horizontal Scaling**:
   - All services are stateless and can be scaled horizontally
   - Kubernetes orchestration for dynamic scaling
   - Load balancers distribute traffic

2. **Chunked Uploads**:
   - Large files are split into manageable chunks (typically 5-10MB)
   - Parallel upload of chunks for better performance
   - Allows for resumable uploads if connection is interrupted

3. **Asynchronous Processing**:
   - Decoupling upload from processing via message queue
   - Background processing of files
   - Event-driven architecture

4. **Caching Strategy**:
   - Redis cache for metadata and frequently accessed files
   - CDN integration for downloads (optional)
   - In-memory caches for authentication tokens

5. **Resource Optimization**:
   - Auto-scaling based on CPU/memory usage and queue depths
   - Request throttling during peak loads
   - Resource quotas per user

## Security Considerations

1. **Authentication & Authorization**:
   - OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect for authentication
   - JWT tokens with short expiry
   - Fine-grained RBAC
   - API key management for service-to-service communication

2. **Data Protection**:
   - TLS for all communications (TLS 1.3)
   - Encryption at rest using AES-256
   - File integrity verification (checksums)
   - Content validation and sanitization

3. **Threat Protection**:
   - Web Application Firewall (WAF)
   - DDoS protection
   - Rate limiting
   - Real-time malware scanning
   - Intrusion detection/prevention

4. **Compliance & Governance**:
   - Comprehensive audit logging
   - Automated retention policies (30-day maximum)
   - Data classification
   - Legal hold capabilities

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Client-Side Optimizations**:
   - Progressive file uploads
   - Client-side chunking
   - WebSockets for status updates
   - Background uploading

2. **Network Optimizations**:
   - HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 support
   - Compression of metadata
   - Strategic data center placement
   - CDN integration for downloads

3. **Server-Side Optimizations**:
   - Streaming processing (no full file buffering)
   - Async I/O operations
   - Connection pooling
   - Batch operations where possible

4. **Storage Optimizations**:
   - Tiered storage (hot/cold)
   - Read-through caching
   - Parallel I/O operations
   - Content-addressable storage

## High Availability Design

1. **No Single Points of Failure**:
   - All components deployed in clusters
   - Multi-zone deployment
   - Automated failover

2. **Data Redundancy**:
   - Database replication
   - File replication across storage nodes
   - Event store replication in message queue
